# 📚 Next.js Dashboard: The Ultimate Bookish Adventure

Welcome to the **Next.js Dashboard**! If you've ever dreamed of running a blog about books while simultaneously avoiding adult responsibilities, congratulations! You’ve found the right place.

## 🚀 What’s This?

This is a **Next.js** project designed to help you review, bookmark, and philosophically ponder your favorite books (or at least pretend to while you binge-watch Netflix). 

## 📖 Features

- **Book Reviews**: Share your deep thoughts on whether a book is a literary masterpiece or just a good way to nap.
- **Bookmarks**: Save your favorite reads for later! Because who has time to read everything at once?
- **Stylish UI**: Looks fancy enough to impress your friends (or at least make them think you’re cultured).
- **Responsive Design**: Access it on any device! Perfect for reading while pretending to work on your phone.

## 📚 Usage

1.	Add Books: Navigate to the “Add Book” page and fill out the details. Remember, “I read it for the articles” isn’t a valid excuse!
2.	Review: Go to the “Reviews” section and see what your fellow bookworms are saying.
3.	Bookmark: Save your favorites and avoid the existential dread of forgetting what you wanted to read next.


## 🤔 Troubleshooting
- 404 Error?: Did you misspell the URL? Remember, “The Great Gatsby” is not the same as “The Grape Gatsby” (unless you’re reviewing wines).
- Server won’t start?: Check your terminal for errors, and make sure you’re not using a potato for a computer.
